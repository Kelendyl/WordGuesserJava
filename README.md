This is a word guessing game inspired by The New York Times Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Player has 6 attempts to guess random 5 letter word from specified list. If letter from player guess is present in the chosen word, it is highlited in yellow.
If it stands on the same position as in the answer, it is highlited in green.

There is no daily restriction on the number of games, and when the word is guessed correctly, the attempt record is saved to a database. 

Player can access their statistics at any time to view graphical representation of their attempts count
